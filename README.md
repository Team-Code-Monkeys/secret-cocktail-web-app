The Secret Cocktail Webapp is an automated phone survey system to help nursing trainees find facilities near them to complete
their required training hours. Our software features a phone survey system that sends questionnaires to facilities and
based on their responses, they can be added to our database of facilities hosting nursing training. We also have a web
application that allows nursing trainees to easily find nearby facilities where they can complete their required
training hours.
